# CodeSense
CodeSense is a Core Python–based static code analysis tool that analyzes Python source files and generates a detailed report about their structure, complexity, and coding issues without using any external libraries, frameworks, or AI.

This project is ideal for:

Engineering students
Core Python viva & practical exams
GitHub portfolio projects
Learning Python internals

📌 Key Highlights

✔ 100% Core Python
✔ No AI / ML / Web frameworks
✔ Command-line based
✔ Beginner-friendly & extendable

🔍 Code Structure Analysis
Counts:
Total lines of code
Functions
Classes
Loops (for, while)
Conditional statements (if, elif, else)

🧮 Variable Usage Analysis
Detects:
Declared variables
Unused variables

📈 Complexity Estimation (Rule-Based)
No loop → O(1)
One loop → O(n)
Two loops → O(n²)
More loops → High Complexity
